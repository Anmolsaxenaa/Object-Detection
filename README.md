#Object detection 
Trained a machine to detect the object that are present in any image and also the Video.

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation.
Used COCO Dataset of about 80 objects in this project and also the 'Frozen' and 'Pure Basics' file that helps in training the machine to detect the objects from the image or any video.
In this project I have added the image ie; sample image of my friend holding a bottle in his hand and the machine recognizes him and the table kept beside him and also a keyboard kept on the table.

Right now it is not working for the real time but I am currently working on it using tensorflow.
You will find the project in the project branch of this repository.
