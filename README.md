#Object detection 
Trained a machine to detect the object that are present in any image and also the Video.

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation.
Used COCO Dataset in this project and also the frozen and Pure Basics file that helps in training the machine to detect the objects from the image or any video.
Right now it is not working for the real time but I am currently working on it using tensorflow.
You will find the project in the project branch of this repository.
